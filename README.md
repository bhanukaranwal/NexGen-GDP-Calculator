  - Income approach (wages, rents, interest, profits)  
  - Production (Output) approach (Gross Value Added by sectors)
- Nominal and Real GDP computation with inflation adjustment and flexible base year support.
- Detailed sectoral, regional, and per capita GDP breakdowns.
- Extended metrics: GNI, NNI, PPP, and related macroeconomic indicators.
- Compliance with IMF, World Bank, and UN SNA 2008 standards.

### 2. Advanced AI/ML Analytics & Forecasting
- Multi-model GDP forecasting using ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, LSTM, Transformers, and ensemble methods.
- Automated feature engineering integrating macro indicators, satellite proxies, social sentiment, and financial data.
- Explainable AI with SHAP/LIME to visualize key GDP drivers.
- Anomaly detection with Isolation Forests and Autoencoders, triggering actionable alerts.
- Interactive scenario simulation for policy impact analysis (e.g., tax, subsidy adjustments).
- Reinforcement Learning-based policy optimizer to recommend fiscal and monetary strategies.

### 3. Multi-Source Data Integration & Management
- Automated API connectors for IMF, World Bank, national statistics, NDAP, MoSPI, and financial markets.
- Support for manual data uploads in CSV, Excel, JSON formats.
- ETL pipelines with data version control, metadata tracking, and lineage audit using blockchain for integrity.
